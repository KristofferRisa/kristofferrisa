### Hi, I'm Kristoffer 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently engaged in several exciting domains:
  - **Bitcoin**: Exploring and learning the fundamental principles behind Bitcoin as a tool for secure, decentralized payment systems and their impact on society. And how Bitcoin works as a decentralized project and the basics of its software design. 
  - **Language Models (LLMs):** Exploring the capabilities and applications of large language models.
  - **Agent Development:** Innovating with Autogen and other frameworks to create intelligent, responsive agents.
  - **Automation:** Utilizing n8n to streamline workflows and processes.
  - **Monitoring:** Implementing OpenTelemetry for robust, scalable system monitoring.
- 📖 Currently reading: "[The Beginning of Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity)" by David Deutsch. A book so insightful, I recommend reading it multiple times!
- 🤔 Seeking collaborators for [Flaggtider.no](https://flaggtider.no) to help take these projects to the next level!
- 🗒 Every day student of Bitcoin.
